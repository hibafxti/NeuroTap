# NeuroTap
Tap-response prototype tracking focus, fatigue, and friction during high-stakes mental load.
------------------

## Overview

NeuroTap is a tap-based cognitive load testing system that uses an ESP32 microcontroller, LED cueing, and tactile response input to measure fatigue-indiced delays in reaction time. Built as a minimal, desktop-connected prototype, it represents the first functioning tool in a broader cognitive neurotechnological suite aimed at tracking mental performance in high-stakes environments.

------------------

## Features
- Reaction time measurement with millisecond precision
- False tap detection (response without cue)
- Serial data logging to CSV
- Minimal interface (command-line)

------------------

## System Overview
- LED flashes at randomized intervals as visual cues
- User taps button in response
- ESP32 microcontroller timestamps all responses
- Output includes valid tap latency and error frequency

------------------

## Hardware 
- ESP32 microcontroller
- Tactile pushbutton
- Breadboard
- USB-C wire
